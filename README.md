Target Platform: Desktop and Mobile. Min width is 380px for the game page
Game Genres: Card, Poker
Objective:  
        Win chips by forming the best five-card hand from a combination of two private cards and five community cards on the table, or by forcing you opponents to fold. The goal is to win all the chips at the table.
Game rules and mechanics: 
        The game unfolds over four betting rounds. After the initial deal, players assess the strength of their hole cards and decide whether to fold, call (match the current bet), or raise. Following this, three community cards (the "flop") are revealed, and another round of betting ensues. A fourth card (the "turn") and a fifth card (the "river") are successively revealed, each accompanied by its own round of betting.
        Players can use any combination of their hole cards and the community cards to form a hand. At showdown, remaining players reveal their hands, and the highest-ranking combination wins the pot.
        Ranking order: Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, Pair, High Card.
